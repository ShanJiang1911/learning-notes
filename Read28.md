## [Intro to Hash Tables](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/resources/Hashtables.html)
```
Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
```
* Why use them:  
  * Hold unique values
  * Dictionary
  * Library 
* Hashtables are data structure that using key value pairs
* Hash Maps can have any number of buckets
* Internal Methods
  *  Add()
  *  Find()
  *  Contains()
  *  GetHash()
