* Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
  * render goes first

* What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
  * Mounting

* Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
  * constructor > render > React Updates > componentDidMount > componentWillUnmount

* What does componentDidMount do?
  * If a component is mounted this method will be invoked. It's a place to load network request or initialize the DOM, as well as set up subscriptions.
