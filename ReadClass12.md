### five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
>SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

>SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
>SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

>SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

>SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  * complex query intensive environment
* Give a real world example.
  * heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data
* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  * Large data set(i.e big data)
* Give a real world example.
  * Hbase
* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  * NoSQL
* Which type of database is best for scalability?
  * SQL, in most situations

* What does SQL stand for?
  * Structured Query Language
* What is a realational database?
  * A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
* What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  * A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each having a unique name.
 A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. Thus a table represents a collection of relationships.
* What is a ‘schema’?
  * A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database
* What is a NoSQL database?
  * NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables
* Howo does it work?
  * Data is typically merged/nested in a few collections
* What is inside of a Mongo database?
  * NoSQL document store model
* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  * MongoDB. MongoDB uses a more complex approach to data storage while allowing complex processing
* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  * Less reliability
