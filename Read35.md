### [Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)
* Graphs: actually a data structure that as a collection of vertices(or nodes) potentially connected by edges
* Directed vs Undirected
  * Directed: Digraph. Every edge is directed
  * Undirected: each edge is undirected
* Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
  * complete: all nodes are connected to all others
  * connected: all nodes has at least edge
  * disconnected: some nodes may not have edges
* Acyclic vs Cyclic
  * acyclic graph: directed graph without cycles
  * Cyclic graph: edge directions form a cycle
* Graph Representation
  * Adjacency Matrix: 2-dimensional array, boolean matrix
  * Adjacency List: a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected. Most common way.
* Weighted Graphs: number assigned to its edges
* Traversals
  * Breadth First: starting at a specific vertex/node
  * Depth First
* Real World Usesï¼š
  * GPS and Mapping
  * Driving Directions
  * Social Networks
  * Airline Traffic
  * Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
