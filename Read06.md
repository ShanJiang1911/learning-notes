### [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)

* Scope: rules how variables and names are looked up in your code

* LEGB rule: Local, Global, Enclosing, and Build-in scopes

* Global scope: the name or variables you defined can be used in all your code. e.g. __main__

* Local scope: the name or variables defined can only be used within the scope

* Global name/statement vs Nonlocal name/statement: 
  * When you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function you create a new local name in the function scope. Use a global statement to modify this behavior. 
  * Nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. You need to use a nonlocal statement If you want to modify them

* globals(): is a built-in function that returns a reference to the current global scope or namespace dictionary




### [Don't be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uqawfl0VHQ)

* Big O notation: time complexity & space complexity. How long and how much memory it takes to perform the algorithm.

* Allows you to quantify and compare different algorithms. Big O usually gives the worst case scenario.

* logarithmic complexity: why binary search is 
helpfull

* difference between exponential-complexity and linear-complexity is huge.
