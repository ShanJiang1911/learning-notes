* Input-->Storage-->Processing-->Output information

* Binary. Back to original everything is 10101010010010111001

* Circuit combine the signals

* Modern circuits can perform billions calculations per second

* Software tell cpu what to do

* When you learn to code you get to find the problem you want to solve and write the software that turn those ideas into reality
