* Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__
* Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__
* Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__
* Callable Python Objects: __call__
* Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__


### [Statistics - Probability](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)
* The normal distribution is significant to probability and statistics thanks to two factors: the Central Limit Theorem and the Three Sigma Rule.
* Z-score:given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean.
