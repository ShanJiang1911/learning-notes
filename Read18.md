* Caesar likes shifting Alphabet by 3 to encrypt messages
* Three main techniques to crack cipher: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force
  ```
  * Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the   alphabet shift).
  * Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret  key.
  * Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
