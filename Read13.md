### [Linear Regression in Python](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/)
* Regression: searches for relationships among variables, to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well
* Linear Regression: one of the most important and widely used regression techniques and it's among the simplest regression methods
* Multiple Linear Regression: linear regression with two or more independent variables
* Polynomial Regression
* Underfitting and Overfitting
* NumPy: a fundamental Python scientific package that allows many high-performance operations on single- and multi-dimensional arrays. It also offers many mathematical routines
* scikit-learn: widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages
* Simple, Multiple and Polynomial Regression With scikit-learn
* Advanced Linear Regression With statsmodels
