## JON DUCKETT'S HTML book:

### HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout”

Review and quote from ch.15 Summary:
* < div > elemetns are often used as containing elemetns to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless user specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the pages and can be used to create multi-column layouts.
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate that what the site is about within the top 600 pixels ( to demonstrate is relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
