### [Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/big_oh.html)
* Big O notation: describe the efficiency of algorithm or function. The evaluation based on 2 factors:
  * running time: the amount of time the function take
  * running space: the amount of memory space function needs to store data and instructions
* Big O describe the worst case of efficiency the algorithm can have. Usually analysis in 4 areas:
  * Input Size--
  * Units of Measurement--Milliseconds; number of excuted operations; number of basic operations; The amount of spaces to hold algorithm, input data, and output data.
  * Orders of Growth
    * O(1)---Constant Complexity  
    * O(lng)---Logarithmic Complexity
    * O(n)---Linearithmic Complexity
    * O(n^2)---Quadratic ComplexityCubic Complexity
    * O(n^3)---Cubic Complexity
    * O(2^n)---Exponential Complexity 
    * O(n!)---Factorial Complexity
  * Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case
* Big Omega: the best case ayalysis of algorithm efficiency
* Big Theta: the typical or random case to test algorithm efficiency




### [Linked Lists](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)
* Linked list: a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other
* Each Node references the next Node in the link
* 2 types: Singly and Doubly
* Terminology: Node, Next, Head, Current
* Can Not use foreach or for loop when traversing a linked list
* While loop is the best way to approach a traversal



### [What’s a Linked List, Anyway? [Part 1]](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-1-d8b7e6508b9d)
* Linked lists are linear data structures, and dynamic data structures
* Circular linked list
