# **What I learned from reading"Mastering Markdown"**

## Markdown is a lightweight syntax which is widely used on Github platform for stying all forms of writing

Examples we can use:

1. list numbers 
* Bullit points you want to add
  - Dash also works, *even you have sub points*
  
We can also share a link like [GitHub](https://github.com/)
