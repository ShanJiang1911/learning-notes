* JSON Web Token (JWT): a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object
* When use JWT:
  * Authorization
  * Information Exchange
* JSON Web Token structure: ```Header.Payload.Signature```
* Click [Here](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to practice decode, verify, and generate JWTs

### [Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html)
* django runserver is built for development convenience, not for production setup
* Nginx is an example for a good web server
```
If you want to run Django in production, be sure to use a production-ready web server like Nginx, and let your app be handled by a WSGI application server like Gunicorn.
If you plan on running on Heroku, a web server is provided implicitly. You donâ€™t have to take care of it. You just need to specify a command to run your application server (again, Gunicorn is fine) in the Procfile
```
