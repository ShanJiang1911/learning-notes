### [Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)
* Binary Trees
* Binary Search Trees
* two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:
  * Depth First
    * Pre-order: root >> left >> right
    * In-order: left >> root >> right
    * Post-order: left >> right >> root
    * The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion
  * Breadth First
    * Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 
* K-ary Trees: If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.
  * The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n)
* Binary Search Trees
  * The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Treeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or o(height) 
  * The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1)
