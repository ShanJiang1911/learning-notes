# Comparison and logical operators: P150-151, 156, and 157
* It's all about true or false
  * '==' : is equal to. If left and right side are same thing, true
  * '===' : strict equal to. Only if they are exactly same. ture
  * '!=' : is not equal. Left and right side are two different values(numbers, strings, or Booleans), true
  * '!==' : strict not equal to. Preffered method. left and right are not the same data type or value, true
  * '>'  : greater than. 4 > 3, true
  * '<' : less than. 3 < 4, true
  * '>=' : greater than or equal to. 4 >= 3, 3 >= 3, true
  * '<=' : less than or equal to. 3 <= 4, 4 <= 4, true
* LOGICAL OPERATORS
  * && : logical and. Only both sides returns true then the expression is ture. Other wise, false
  * || ：logical or. Only both sides returns false then the expression is false. Other wise, true
  * ！ ： logical not. reverse true or false. If it is true, false. If it is false, true.

# FOR and WHILE loops: P170-173, P176
* For: run code a specific times.
* While: as long as it's true, the loop will keep running
* Do While: Even if the condition is false, it will run once
* for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    document.write(i)
}
  * for: Keyword
  * (let i = 0; i < 10; i++): condition(counter)
  * document.write(i): code to excute during loop
  * {}: Opening and closing curly brace
